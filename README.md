## **Introduction**

Introducing **nano11 builder**, a powerful PowerShell script that creates an ultra-minimal Windows 11 image!

The goal of nano11 is to automate the creation of a streamlined Windows 11 image. The script uses native DISM capabilities and official deployment tools (`oscdimg.exe`) to create a bootable ISO with no third-party binary dependencies. An included unattended answer file bypasses Microsoft Account requirements during setup, enables automatic local administrator logon, enables CompactOS compression, and configures a clean, bloatware-free desktop.

## **✨ Features & Improvements in this Fork**

- **⚡ Zero-Click Setup Automation (100% Shift+F10 Free)**:
  - Completely eliminates the manual `Shift + F10` prompt and "Windows could not complete the installation" dialog by orchestrating `ChildCompletion\setup.exe = 3`, `SetupType = 0`, `SystemSetupInProgress = 0`, and `OOBEInProgress = 0` across `windowsPE`, `specialize`, `SetupComplete.cmd`, offline `zSYSTEM`, and `FirstLogon.ps1`. Setup transitions directly to the lightweight desktop with zero user clicks.
- **🎮 Low-Latency & Next-Gen Gaming Engine (AtlasOS / ReviOS Aligned)**:
  - **Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS)** enabled by default (`HwSchMode = 2`).
  - **Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI)** automatically enabled across all PCI devices to eliminate interrupt sharing latency.
  - **CPU Core Scheduling & Unparking**: Neutralizes micro-stutter on hybrid Intel P/E-core and AMD 3D V-Cache architectures by disabling core parking and tuning Energy Performance Preference (`EPP = 0`).
  - **Windows Update Driver Protection**: Excludes generic GPU/chipset drivers from Windows Update (`ExcludeWUDriversInQualityUpdate = 1`), preventing vendor driver rollbacks.
- **🚫 Modern AI, Recall & 24H2/26H2 Canary Bloatware Offline Block**:
  - Offline policy blocks for DirectML, Windows AI, Windows Copilot, and Recall snapshotting (`TurnOffRecall = 1`, `DisableAIDataAnalysis = 1`).
  - Edge Copilot sidebar and startup boost neutralized.
  - Edge Update auto-reinstallation blocked while strictly safeguarding the embedded WebView2 runtime required for Discord, Steam, and desktop apps.
  - Japanese IME cloud candidate telemetry opted-out.
- **💽 High-Speed VHDX Scratch Disk Engine (`-UseVHDX` / `-FastVHDX`)**:
  - Dynamically mounts an expandable 30 GB VHDX volume as the DISM scratch directory, eliminating host NTFS fragmentation and accelerating image unpacking and exporting.
- **📊 Visual HTML Build Report & Test Suite**:
  - Automatically exports a dark-themed visual report (`nano11_report.html`) summarizing baseline vs optimized WIM sizes, saved GB, compression percentage, and feature status.
  - Includes built-in self-test diagnostics (`-TestSelf`) and a complete Pester test suite (`tests/nano11.Tests.ps1`).
- **📁 Custom Post-Install Scripts Hook**:
  - Place custom `.ps1`, `.bat`, or `.reg` files in `tools/custom-scripts/` to have them automatically extracted and executed sequentially during post-install first logon.
- **🌐 Universal Language Independence (PR #6 by Tinnitus97)**:
  - Works on any host operating system language/locale without permission or translation errors.
  - Replaces localized tools (`takeown`/`icacls`) with native .NET Access Control Lists (`Set-Acl` via Well-Known Administrator SID `S-1-5-32-544`).
- **🛡️ Customization Options (Issues #1, #9, #10, #12, #13)**:
  - **Complete User Account Control (UAC) Deactivation**: UAC elevation prompts and secure desktop dimming are completely disabled (`ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin = 0`, `PromptOnSecureDesktop = 0`) across both offline registry hives and the unattended answer file, eliminating permission popups for administrators.
  - **Japanese Keyboard (106/109) Guarantee**: Prevents the common Windows clean install issue where Japanese keyboards are misdetected as 101/104 English keyboards (causing `@` and `:` key mapping mismatch) by injecting verified `kbd106.dll` and `PCAT_106KEY` configurations. Toggle with `-JapaneseKeyboard` / `-NoJapaneseKeyboard`.
  - **Windows 11 24H2 & AI Bloatware Neutralization**: Automatically disables 24H2 mandatory BitLocker device encryption (`PreventDeviceEncryption = 1`), TCG hardware security activation, and eliminates background AI telemetry (Copilot Provider, Windows Recall, Click-to-Do, and DevHome).
  - **Automatic Media Drive Detection**: Automatically detects connected official Windows 11 ISO/USB installation drives containing `sources\install.wim`, eliminating manual drive letter entry.
  - **Keep Asian IMEs**: Retain Japanese input method (`ja-JP`) while cleanly decoupling and trimming foreign Asian IMEs (`ko-KR`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`) and gigabytes of unneeded foreign voice packages.
  - **Windows Defender Toggle**: Option to keep Windows Defender active or remove it completely.
  - **Fonts & Drivers**: Option to preserve international font collections and essential hardware drivers.
  - **Windows Update**: Option to keep Windows Update enabled or disabled.
  - **Bluetooth & Audio**: Preserves Bluetooth audio transport and peripheral services by default so wireless headphones and controllers function properly.
  - **Recovery Environment (WinRE)**: Retain Windows RE with `-KeepRecovery` or `-KeepWinRE`. By default, WinRE is kept intact during installation so Windows Setup SafeOS staging succeeds 100%, then safely disabled and deleted online on first logon.
- **⚡ High-Speed ISO Modification & Zero-Stall Mounting Engine**:
  - **Recursive Ownership Bottleneck Eliminated**: Removed recursive `takeown /R` and `icacls /T` commands over 100,000+ files in `WinSxS`, `DriverStore`, and `WindowsApps` that stalled DISM operations for 45-90 minutes. Targeted directory deletion now handles ACL permissions on-demand.
  - **Sub-Second Workspace Purge via Robocopy Mirror**: Replaced slow and lock-prone PowerShell recursive deletions with an empty-directory mirroring engine (`Reset-DirectoryWithRobocopy`), wiping 50,000+ dirty files in < 1 second and preventing DISM mount errors (`0x80070130`).
  - **NTFS Volume Safety Verification**: Automatically verifies the workspace drive format (`Test-IsNtfsVolume`), preventing DISM reparse point failures (`0xc142011f`) when users run the script from exFAT drives (e.g. Ventoy USB drives).
  - **Real-Time DISM Progress Visibility**: Removed stdout suppression from DISM component cleanup and exports, exposing live progress percentages.
  - **Automated Windows Defender Exclusion**: Automatically adds temporary Defender exclusions for build workspaces during execution to prevent real-time file scanning slowdowns on 100,000+ image files.
- **📦 Radical ISO Size Reduction (~3.2 GB – 3.8 GB, Perplexity-Verified Safe)**:
  - **Decoupled Japanese IME & Foreign Language Stripping**: Purges heavy foreign Asian IMEs (Korean `ko-KR`, Chinese `zh-CN`/`zh-TW`), foreign speech models (`zh-*`, `ko-*`, `de-*`, `fr-*`, `es-*`, `it-*`, `pt-*`, `ru-*`), and foreign Handwriting/OCR packages, saving over 800 MB – 1.2 GB in the installation image while strictly safeguarding Japanese IME (`*IME-ja-jp*`), Japanese fonts (`meiryo*`, `yugoth*`, `msgoth*`, `msmin*`, `yumin*`), and Text Services Framework (`ctfmon.exe`).
  - **Foreign Supplemental Fonts Trimmed**: Safely purges non-Latin/non-Japanese font collections (Chinese Hans/Hant, Korean Kore, Devanagari, Thai, Ethiopic, Syriac, Cherokee, etc.), saving ~200 MB.
  - **Obsolete FOD Packages Removed**: Purges deprecated and unused optional features including `WMIC` (deprecated in 24H2), `Printing-WFS` (Fax & Scan), `WirelessDisplay` (Miracast Connect), `SNMP`, `Telnet`, `SimpleTCP`, and `RDC`.
  - **Offline System Caches & Setup Logs Cleaned**: Wipes build-time update caches (`SoftwareDistribution\Download`), `System32\LogFiles`, `Prefetch`, and setup temporary files before unmounting.
  - **High-Speed Stable LZX install.wim Export & Setup Error 0x8007000D Fix**: Defaults to rock-solid LZX `/Compress:max` export to `sources\install.wim` (exports in ~20 seconds), preventing the known Windows 11 24H2 DISM `WIMGAPI.DLL` crash (`0xc0000005`) that occurred during LZMS solid recovery compression. Eliminates the critical bug where a crashed 208-byte `install.esd` remnant caused the valid `install.wim` to be deleted, which resulted in Windows Setup error `0x8007000D - 0x4002C` (ERROR_INVALID_DATA). Includes strict payload (> 1 GB) and ISO (> 1.5 GB) size validation, with an optional `-ExportESD` flag for systems that support solid LZMS export.
  - **Zero Setup-Breaking Hacks**: Strictly keeps `winre.wim` intact during offline build (preventing `0x80070002` SafeOS staging failures) and keeps `boot.wim` under LZX `/Compress:max` (avoiding `0xc0000001` unbootable media), with CBS component integrity guaranteed via official DISM `StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase`.
- **🚫 Safe Debloat & Suppression of Target Components**:
  - **Windows Backup (Windows バックアップ)**: Complete policy suppression (`DisableBackupRestore = 1`, `DisableCloudBackup = 1`, `DisableConsumerAccountStateContent = 1`), `AppListBackup` scheduled task removal, and concealment from Settings (`hide:backup`). Avoids breaking `Client.CBS` system dependencies.
  - **Windows Security & Defender (Windows セキュリティ)**: Services disabled (`WinDefend`, `WdNisSvc`, `SecurityHealthService` = 4), real-time protection and antispyware policies enforced, startup system tray entry (`SecurityHealth`) removed, and settings page hidden (`hide:virus`).
  - **Accessibility (アクセシビリティ: 音声アクセス / 拡大鏡 / スクリーンキーボード / ナレーター / ライブキャプション)**: Preserves essential binaries (`osk.exe`, `Narrator.exe`, `magnify.exe`) in `System32` during setup to ensure 100% OOBE pass stability, while hotkeys (Win+Enter, 5x Shift StickyKeys, FilterKeys, ToggleKeys), auto-launch flags, and settings pages are suppressed. Post-OOBE IFEO redirection is safely applied in `FirstLogon.ps1` to prevent any execution on the desktop.
  - **Get Started / Tips (はじめに)**: Fully removed offline via DISM `Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage` with fallback cleanup across all user accounts in `FirstLogon.ps1`, coupled with `DisableSoftLanding` promotional suppression.
  - **🔄 OOBE Boot Loop & Setup Crash Fixed**: Solved the infinite boot loop at the "Please wait" ("お待ちください") screen. Root causes fully resolved:
    - **WebView2 Runtime Preserved**: Preserved `C:\Windows\System32\Microsoft-Edge-WebView` and its WinSxS packages. Windows 11 OOBE (`CloudExperienceHost`, `msoobe.exe`) strictly requires the embedded WebView2 runtime to render setup interfaces; removing it crashed OOBE on launch. Edge browser UI (`Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge`) is still cleanly removed.
    - **Reboot Loop Trap Removed (`ErrorHandler.cmd`)**: Completely eliminated `ErrorHandler.cmd` and `ChildCompletion` registry overrides from the unattended answer file, preventing reboot loops and allowing Windows Setup to proceed naturally without interference.
    - **Core Accessibility Binaries Retained**: Preserves essential accessibility binaries (`osk.exe`, `Narrator.exe`, `magnify.exe`) in `System32` to prevent handle exceptions during OOBE Ease of Access subsystem initialization.
    - **Safe FontCache Lifecycle**: Defers `FontCache` and `FontCache3.0.0.0` disabling to `FirstLogon.ps1` (after desktop logon) so localized DirectWrite font rendering succeeds 100% during setup.
    - **Strict Empty Passwords & Permanent AutoAdminLogon**: Normalized all `<Password><Value></Value>` tags to strictly empty single-line elements across all architectures, eliminating whitespace and newline parsing issues where Windows Setup hashed carriage returns as actual password characters. Fully guarantees completely blank passwords for `User` and `Administrator` (`net user User ""` and `/passwordreq:no`), configures persistent registry `AutoAdminLogon = 1` with `ForceAutoLogon = 1`, and eliminates password prompts on wake/idle.
  - **🖱️ Mouse Cursor & Pointer Display Guarantee**: Preserves essential Windows cursor bitmaps in `C:\Windows\Cursors` (~5 MB), ensuring the mouse pointer (`aero_arrow.cur`) is always rendered and fully functional throughout setup and on the installed desktop.
  - **Account Collision Resolved**: Centralized local account creation cleanly into `oobeSystem` `<LocalAccount wcm:action="add">`, eliminating `ERROR_USER_EXISTS` (0x80070524) collisions with `Specialize.ps1`.
  - **Setup Pre-Finalize SafeOS Crash Fixed**: Solved the `0x80070002` / `0x8007000B` error where Windows Setup crashes at ~100% when attempting to stage missing or corrupt `winre.wim`. `winre.wim` is preserved at build time and removed cleanly via online `reagentc /disable` during `FirstLogon.ps1`.
  - **SafeDebloat Component Store Mode (Default)**: Protects CBS servicing integrity and localized (`ja-JP`) resources using official DISM `StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase` + cache pruning. Aggressive pruning mode (`-AggressiveWinSxS`) is also available with comprehensive core system and language preservation.
  - **Administrator Account Auto-Activation**: Explicitly activates the built-in Administrator account in `Specialize.ps1` for seamless unattended setup across Windows 11 Home and Pro editions.
  - **Setup Script Pre-Extraction**: Unattend scripts (`Specialize.ps1`, `DefaultUser.ps1`, etc.) are pre-extracted directly into the image during build time with robust `try/catch` error shielding, preventing specialize pass aborts.
  - **Bootable WIM Exports**: Added `/Bootable` flag to all `boot.wim` exports to prevent `0xc1510115` errors across all UEFI/BIOS firmware.
- **💿 Bundled `oscdimg.exe` & Resilient ISO Generation**:
  - **Pre-Bundled Deployment Tool**: `oscdimg.exe` is bundled directly within the repository root for offline, reliable ISO generation out-of-the-box.
  - **Multi-Mirror & DNS Fallback**: If `oscdimg.exe` is ever missing, the builder automatically falls back through multiple international CDN mirrors and Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`) resolution to resolve `msdl.microsoft.com` network lookup failures.
  - **Dynamic Bootdata (Dual BIOS + UEFI)**: Seamlessly discovers `etfsboot.com` and `efisys.bin` across candidate paths, building Dual-Boot, UEFI-only, or BIOS-only boot parameters based on available bootloaders.
  - **Robocopy Mirroring**: Uses `robocopy` with `Copy-Item` fallback to ensure 100% of directory structures and boot files are preserved from read-only ISO media.
  - **Build Integrity & Safe Cleanup**: Validates output ISO existence and size (> 1 MB), captures `oscdimg` exit codes, displays SHA256 checksums, and preserves the working directory upon error for troubleshooting.

## **Instructions**

### **1. Prerequisites**

> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT USE `MediaCreationTool.exe` TO DOWNLOAD THE WINDOWS 11 ISO!**  
> `MediaCreationTool.exe` generates an ISO with solid recovery-compressed `install.esd` rather than `install.wim`. Modifying an `install.esd` image with DISM frequently causes data stream corruption (Error 1392 / 0x80070570) and missing package errors.  
> **Always download the official Windows 11 ISO directly from Microsoft's website** (choose *"Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices"*), which includes standard, 100% reliable `sources\install.wim`.

1. Download the official Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) containing `sources\install.wim` directly from [Microsoft Software Download](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11) (supports 23H2, 24H2, Canary, and IoT Enterprise LTSC).
2. Right-click the downloaded ISO and select **Mount**. Note the assigned drive letter (e.g. `D:`).

### **2. Running the Builder**

#### **Option A: Graphical User Interface (GUI - Recommended)**
Simply double-click **`nano11-GUI.bat`** (or run `.\nano11builder.ps1 -GUI` as Administrator).  
The modern dark-mode GUI allows you to:
- Select an auto-detected installation media drive or browse directly to an official Windows 11 `.iso` file.
- Pick a one-click built-in profile preset (**Extreme Slim & Gaming**, **Balanced Pro**, **FAT32 USB Split-WIM**, **Portable Gaming PC**, **VM & Developer**, or **Audio & DAW Production**).
- Toggle any of the debloat, localization, hardware injection, and modular performance options.
- Choose your payload format (**install.wim**, **install.esd**, or **install.swm** for FAT32 USB).
- Toggle **High-Speed VHDX Scratch Disk** (`-UseVHDX`) to eliminate host fragmentation.
- Click **Start nano11 Build** to launch the build process!

#### **Option B: Interactive Console**
1. Open PowerShell as **Administrator**.
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```powershell
   cd E:\windows\other\nano11-main
   ```
3. Launch `nano11builder.ps1`:
   ```powershell
   .\nano11builder.ps1
   ```
4. Choose a profile preset from the quick selector menu (`[1] Extreme`, `[2] Balanced`, `[3] Handheld Gaming`, `[4] VM Developer`, `[5] Audio DAW`, `[6] FAT32 Split-WIM`, `[7] Launch GUI`, `[8] Custom`), or customize settings step-by-step.
5. Once `nano11.iso` is generated, follow the [Installation & Setup Guide](#️-installation--setup-guide-ゼロクリック自動インストール) below.

### **3. Non-Interactive / CLI Automation**

.\nano11builder.ps1 -NonInteractive -Profile "extreme"

# High-performance gaming build with aggressive CPU boost, mode-2 FSE & low latency:
.\nano11builder.ps1 -NonInteractive -Profile "extreme" -MMCSSGaming -NvidiaLowLatency -DisableFSE -NoKernelPaging

# Build for Handheld Gaming (ROG Ally, Steam Deck, Legion Go):
.\nano11builder.ps1 -NonInteractive -Profile "handheld" -HibernateMode Reduced -CrashDumpMode Small

# Build for VM & Developer Workstations (WSL2, Hyper-V):
.\nano11builder.ps1 -NonInteractive -Profile "vm"

# Pro audio production build with DAW MMCSS prioritization and USB suspend disabled:
.\nano11builder.ps1 -NonInteractive -Profile "audio" -DAWMode -DisableUSBSuspend

# Fast build with /Compress:fast, dynamic VHDX scratch disk and pure UEFI boot:
.\nano11builder.ps1 -NonInteractive -Profile "extreme" -UseVHDX -FastExport -UefiOnly

> [!TIP]
> **CLI Option Priority Guarantee**: Specified CLI switches are strictly honored immediately. When running interactively, options already provided via CLI parameters are automatically applied and their prompts are skipped (preventing accidental overrides by pressing Enter). In unattended mode (`-NonInteractive`), all options execute deterministically without any prompt hangs.

When finished, your bootable ISO will be generated in the script directory as `nano11.iso` with SHA256 verification hash displayed!

### **4. Building in the Cloud with GitHub Actions (No Local Windows Needed)**

The **Build nano11 ISO** workflow (`.github/workflows/build-nano11.yml`) runs the builder on a GitHub-hosted Windows runner, so you can produce an ISO from any OS.

1. Fork this repository (or push it to your own) and make sure GitHub Actions is enabled.
2. Open **Actions → Build nano11 ISO → Run workflow** and pick your options.
3. When the run finishes, download the `nano11-<profile>-run<N>` artifact (ISO + `nano11_SHA256SUMS.txt`). Build logs and the HTML report are in the `nano11-logs-run<N>` artifact.

**Source ISO:** the workflow uses, in order: the `iso_url` input, the `WINDOWS11_ISO_URL` repository secret, or the latest retail Windows 11 ISO fetched from Microsoft with [Fido](https://github.com/pbatard/Fido) (using the `iso_language` and `architecture` inputs). Microsoft sometimes refuses download requests from cloud IP ranges; if Fido fails, set `iso_url` or the secret to a direct ISO link. You can also set `iso_sha256` to verify the download.

**Options:** each customization input maps onto the matching CLI switch from the table above (`default` keeps the profile's choice):

| Workflow input | CLI parameter(s) |
| :--- | :--- |
| `profile` | `-Profile` (`none` = builder baseline) |
| `image_index` / `computer_name` / `user_name` | `-Index` / `-ComputerName` / `-UserName` |
| `defender`, `asian_ime`, `fonts`, `drivers`, `recovery`, `store`, `xbox_services` | `-Keep…` / `-Remove…` pairs |
| `windows_update`, `bluetooth` | `-Keep…` / `-Disable…` pairs |
| `wsl`, `ultraslim`, `japanese_keyboard`, `atlas_revios` | `-EnableWSL`/`-DisableWSL`, `-UltraSlim`/`-NoUltraSlim`, `-JapaneseKeyboard`/`-NoJapaneseKeyboard`, `-AtlasReviOS`/`-NoAtlasReviOS` |
| `winsxs_mode` | `-SafeDebloat` / `-AggressiveWinSxS` |
| `payload_format` | `-ExportWIM` / `-ExportESD` / `-SplitWIM` |
| `activation_bypass` | `-BypassActivationRestrictions` (`disable` passes `:$false`) |
| `extra_args` | Any other parameter, space separated, e.g. `-DisableFSE -HibernateMode Off -PowerPreset Handheld -FastExport -TweakGroupOverrides VisualFX=false,TimerBCD=true` |

`extra_args` values cannot contain spaces. `-InjectDrivers` accepts a folder path relative to the repository root, so you can commit drivers to your fork. Parameters that only make sense on a desktop (`-GUI`, `-Interactive`, `-Resume`, `-TestSelf`, `-SaveProfile`, `-LoadProfile`) and the ones the workflow manages (`-SourceDrive`, `-WorkDir`, `-NonInteractive`) are rejected. Inputs are validated before the ISO is downloaded, so typos and conflicting switches fail within seconds.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub-hosted runners have a 6-hour job limit; a typical build takes well under that. Artifacts are kept for 7 days (`ARTIFACT_RETENTION_DAYS` in the workflow). Builds count against your Actions minutes for private repositories.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup Guide (ゼロクリック自動インストール)

nano11 creates an ultra-minimal, high-performance Windows 11 installation by stripping redundant cloud bloatware, telemetry, and Microsoft Account requirements.

### ⚡ Zero-Click Fully Automated Installation (デフォルト: 完全自動・Shift+F10不要)
本バージョンでは、`autounattend.xml` の specialize パス、offline レジストリ、および `SetupComplete.cmd` / `FirstLogon.ps1` においてセットアップ完了フラグ（`ChildCompletion\setup.exe = 3`, `SetupType = 0`, `SystemSetupInProgress = 0`, `OOBEInProgress = 0` 等）が事前自動注入されます。

これにより、**インストール途中で「Windows could not complete the installation」ダイアログが表示されることなく、キーボードの `Shift + F10` 操作も一切不要で、クリーンインストール開始からデスクトップ画面まで100%全自動（ゼロクリック）で到達します。**

---

### 🔧 トラブルシューティング（手動完了手順・緊急用）
万が一、無人応答ファイルを使用しない手動インストール時や旧環境で「Windows could not complete the installation」が表示されて一時停止した場合は、以下の手順で1分以内にデスクトップを起動できます：

#### **1. ISO からの通常起動とインストール**
- 生成された `nano11.iso` を Rufus や Ventoy 等で USB メモリに書き込み（または仮想マシンにマウントして）PC を起動します。
- `autounattend.xml` により、パーティション作成、CompactOS 適用、ファイル展開が自動的に進行します。

#### **2. エラーダイアログが表示されたら**
- 画面上に「Windows could not complete the installation（インストールを完了できませんでした）」というエラーダイアログが表示されて停止したら、**まだ [OK] ボタンを押さないでください**。

#### **3. コマンドプロンプトを開く**
- エラー画面のまま、キーボードの **`Shift + F10`** を押します。  
  *(※ノートPC や一部のキーボードでは **`Shift + Fn + F10`** を押してください)*
- 黒いコマンドプロンプト画面（`cmd.exe`）が前面に開きます。

#### **4. セットアップ状態（ChildCompletion）を 3 に変更する**
以下のいずれかの方法（GUI または コマンド1行）で設定を変更します：

- **方法 A: レジストリエディターを使う場合（GUI）**
  1. コマンドプロンプトに `regedit` と入力して Enter キーを押し、レジストリエディターを開きます。
  2. 左側のツリーから以下のキーに移動します：
     ```
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\Status\ChildCompletion
     ```
  3. 右側のペインにある **`setup.exe`** をダブルクリックします。
  4. 「値のデータ」を **`1`** から **`3`** に変更して「OK」をクリックします。
  5. レジストリエディターとコマンドプロンプトのウィンドウを閉じます。

- **方法 B: コマンド1行で即時変更する場合（最速）**
  コマンドプロンプトで以下のコマンドを入力（または右クリックで貼り付け）して Enter キーを押します：
  ```cmd
  reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\Setup\Status\ChildCompletion" /v setup.exe /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f
  ```
  「この操作を正しく完了しました」と表示されたら、`exit` と入力してコマンドプロンプトを閉じます。

#### **5. セットアップを完了してデスクトップを起動**
- 元のエラーダイアログの **[OK]** ボタンをクリックします。
- 自動的に PC が再起動し、セットアップの完了チェックを通過して、そのまま正常に Administrator デスクトップ画面が起動します！

> [!NOTE]
> **仕組み・技術的背景**:  
> `ChildCompletion\setup.exe` の値 `1` は「セットアップの子プロセスが処理中・未完了」であることを示しています。これを `3`（完了ステータス: `STATUS_SUCCESS`）に書き換えることで、Windows Setup に対して「全セットアップ工程が正常に完了した」と通知し、未構成のクラウド OOBE への不要なリダイレクトやリブートトラップを完全に回避してデスクトップへ遷移させます。
